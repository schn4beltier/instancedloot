# InstancedLoot

**InstancedLoot ensures that every player gets their own unique chest loot, instead of competing for the same items.**

Unlike other mods, it works **entirely server-side** – no client installation required – making it fully compatible with **vanilla clients** and lightweight to run.


## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with vanilla clients?**  
Yes – players don’t need to install anything. The mod runs 100% server-side.  

**Q: Is it compatible with other loot mods?**  
Generally yes, as long as they use standard Minecraft loot tables. Custom behavior may require compatibility patches.  

**Q: Which containers are supported?**  
Chests (single/double), barrels, and any `RandomizableContainerBlockEntity` with a loot table.
Entity containers like minecarts are not yet supported, but planned to be implemented.

Credits go to Lootr for the inspiration, but I needed something that was server-side and vanilla-compatible.
